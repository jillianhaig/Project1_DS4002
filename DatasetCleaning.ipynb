And in this case, the great marriage between Disney and Pixar work so well that the result is Magic. Magic for its original scenario, for the characters, the design and of course, and above all, the terrific animation. While a rat is not a very lovable animal, Pixar succeeded to make a little rodent, and all his family, most adorable and friendly. I tell you, you wont see a rat the same way after watching ratatouille ! By the way, the selling of rats in the UK, as a pet, had been grown up to 50 % since the release of the movie. Not 10/10 because of the score and the song, sang in a very weak, broken french. But over-whole, once again, a great journey into magic. Dreamworks can still manage and try to do better. But without a good writer and director, they will only do pale copies.\",\n          \"With the release of Tangled and Frozen so close together, Disney is showing that it still has the quality that we loved of it in the late 80's and 90's.<br/><br/>While I feel that the story wasn't quite as captivating as that of Tangled's, the musical numbers more than make up for it, special praise being for \\\"Do You Want to Build a Snowman\\\" and (obviously) \\\"Let it Go\\\". The strength of these musical numbers (in my opinion) pulls this up to a par with Tangled.<br/><br/>What I give more praise for is the film's originality in terms of plot, it's not every day that I watch a Disney film and find myself pondering who the main antagonist will be, and how the film will end, hats off to that, and for giving yet more empowered female characters. It's good to see Disney moving along with the times.<br/><br/>All in all I recommend this film to any fan of Disney, and any film fan in general, I wasn't sure what all the buzz was about at first, but now I have seen it I can see it is justified. 10/10\",\n          \"I've always been very impressed by animated films, I think they're generally of a very high standard. There is a strange apprehension that many adults seem to have about them; that they're silly, just for kids. It's completely irrational. I think animation is actually the \\\"genre\\\" with the highest consistent standard. They almost always have far more detail than live-action entertainment. Everything you see was specifically put there, it was built from scratch. Nowadays it's possible to get lazy with the use of computers, but with the right attitude, CGI only opens up more possibilities. It also allows for more exaggeration and symbolism; you aren't limited to the reality everyone is used to. You can set up your own rules which is far more refreshing and exciting.<br/><br/>The characters are very strong and human in Frozen, especially Ana. She loves her sister Elsa and just wants to play with her all the time. She loves her so much that it hurts every time she's turned down and yet she is still just as excited to play with her the next time. There is a lot of physical comedy with Ana. She is very energetic and positive and careless. We see her heart and her insecurities, she is very likable.<br/><br/>The story is quite adult in some ways. Many families will experience some kind of strain or separation, whether temporary or permanent. Each side has their own point of view and are often trying to do the right thing; it's complicated. People get hurt, years pass and there is anger and guilt and regret. And hopefully, there is still love.<br/><br/>The characters we meet are all interesting and quirky. We get a good feel for their personality from the get-go. There are twists that may teach kids to think twice about first impressions. Elsa isn't evil but is conflicted and dangerous which is a nice change from typical villains in movies. The action scenes are done really well. There are only a few parts that are a bit weaker or predictable (the troll song seems unnecessary). The voice-acting is fun and varied, they say lines in interesting ways that bring out more meaning.<br/><br/>Olaf is very funny and offbeat. He fills in a familiar position in these kinds of movies but his timing and manner is unique. You aren't quite sure what he's going to say but it's generally very funny. He makes matter-of-fact observations halfway between obvious and profound.<br/><br/>Although the music is very nice, I think the transitions were too forced and artificial. A bit too perfect. The songs fall too conveniently into standard show-stopping number formats. Reminds me of Wicked and Glee - let's all stop and sing loudly and proudly and colourfully with shining lights on us. It should be natural, an emotional expression of the character's feelings and desires. Not a show-off piece of pop music with \\\"hilarious\\\" lines thrown in. Still, the songs are very good and sometimes funny. But there could be more of a common thread or style running through them and more originality or boldness.<br/><br/>It's unfair and naive that the world seems to look down at \\\"kid's movies\\\" (any genre other than drama apparently deserves no respect). If anything, they usually achieve more than other films. They manage to move us, make us laugh or sing or smile or cry. They do this without swearing or being excessively violent or sexual (easy ways to affect people or to be \\\"ground-breaking\\\"). They draw us in with simple, beautiful stories and characters. All made possible by the tremendous amount of talent, passion and hard-work going on behind the scenes.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"UniqueID\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 23,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Zootopia 2016\",\n          \"Toy Story 4 2019\",\n          \"Inside Out 2015\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"release_date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"date\",\n        \"min\": \"2000-12-15 00:00:00\",\n        \"max\": \"2019-06-21 00:00:00\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 22,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2015-06-19 00:00:00\",\n          \"2013-06-21 00:00:00\",\n          \"2014-11-07 00:00:00\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"recent?\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

And in this case, the great marriage between Disney and Pixar work so well that the result is Magic. Magic for its original scenario, for the characters, the design and of course, and above all, the terrific animation. While a rat is not a very lovable animal, Pixar succeeded to make a little rodent, and all his family, most adorable and friendly. I tell you, you wont see a rat the same way after watching ratatouille ! By the way, the selling of rats in the UK, as a pet, had been grown up to 50 % since the release of the movie. Not 10/10 because of the score and the song, sang in a very weak, broken french. But over-whole, once again, a great journey into magic. Dreamworks can still manage and try to do better. But without a good writer and director, they will only do pale copies.\",\n          \"With the release of Tangled and Frozen so close together, Disney is showing that it still has the quality that we loved of it in the late 80's and 90's.<br/><br/>While I feel that the story wasn't quite as captivating as that of Tangled's, the musical numbers more than make up for it, special praise being for \\\"Do You Want to Build a Snowman\\\" and (obviously) \\\"Let it Go\\\". The strength of these musical numbers (in my opinion) pulls this up to a par with Tangled.<br/><br/>What I give more praise for is the film's originality in terms of plot, it's not every day that I watch a Disney film and find myself pondering who the main antagonist will be, and how the film will end, hats off to that, and for giving yet more empowered female characters. It's good to see Disney moving along with the times.<br/><br/>All in all I recommend this film to any fan of Disney, and any film fan in general, I wasn't sure what all the buzz was about at first, but now I have seen it I can see it is justified. 10/10\",\n          \"I've always been very impressed by animated films, I think they're generally of a very high standard. There is a strange apprehension that many adults seem to have about them; that they're silly, just for kids. It's completely irrational. I think animation is actually the \\\"genre\\\" with the highest consistent standard. They almost always have far more detail than live-action entertainment. Everything you see was specifically put there, it was built from scratch. Nowadays it's possible to get lazy with the use of computers, but with the right attitude, CGI only opens up more possibilities. It also allows for more exaggeration and symbolism; you aren't limited to the reality everyone is used to. You can set up your own rules which is far more refreshing and exciting.<br/><br/>The characters are very strong and human in Frozen, especially Ana. She loves her sister Elsa and just wants to play with her all the time. She loves her so much that it hurts every time she's turned down and yet she is still just as excited to play with her the next time. There is a lot of physical comedy with Ana. She is very energetic and positive and careless. We see her heart and her insecurities, she is very likable.<br/><br/>The story is quite adult in some ways. Many families will experience some kind of strain or separation, whether temporary or permanent. Each side has their own point of view and are often trying to do the right thing; it's complicated. People get hurt, years pass and there is anger and guilt and regret. And hopefully, there is still love.<br/><br/>The characters we meet are all interesting and quirky. We get a good feel for their personality from the get-go. There are twists that may teach kids to think twice about first impressions. Elsa isn't evil but is conflicted and dangerous which is a nice change from typical villains in movies. The action scenes are done really well. There are only a few parts that are a bit weaker or predictable (the troll song seems unnecessary). The voice-acting is fun and varied, they say lines in interesting ways that bring out more meaning.<br/><br/>Olaf is very funny and offbeat. He fills in a familiar position in these kinds of movies but his timing and manner is unique. You aren't quite sure what he's going to say but it's generally very funny. He makes matter-of-fact observations halfway between obvious and profound.<br/><br/>Although the music is very nice, I think the transitions were too forced and artificial. A bit too perfect. The songs fall too conveniently into standard show-stopping number formats. Reminds me of Wicked and Glee - let's all stop and sing loudly and proudly and colourfully with shining lights on us. It should be natural, an emotional expression of the character's feelings and desires. Not a show-off piece of pop music with \\\"hilarious\\\" lines thrown in. Still, the songs are very good and sometimes funny. But there could be more of a common thread or style running through them and more originality or boldness.<br/><br/>It's unfair and naive that the world seems to look down at \\\"kid's movies\\\" (any genre other than drama apparently deserves no respect). If anything, they usually achieve more than other films. They manage to move us, make us laugh or sing or smile or cry. They do this without swearing or being excessively violent or sexual (easy ways to affect people or to be \\\"ground-breaking\\\"). They draw us in with simple, beautiful stories and characters. All made possible by the tremendous amount of talent, passion and hard-work going on behind the scenes.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"UniqueID\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 23,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Zootopia 2016\",\n          \"Toy Story 4 2019\",\n          \"Inside Out 2015\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"release_date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"date\",\n        \"min\": \"2000-12-15 00:00:00\",\n        \"max\": \"2019-06-21 00:00:00\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 22,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2015-06-19 00:00:00\",\n          \"2013-06-21 00:00:00\",\n          \"2014-11-07 00:00:00\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"recent?\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"negative\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.04590281107376132,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.497,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 301,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.154,\n          0.21\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"positive\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.08313879630670448,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.88,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 561,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.597,\n          0.307\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"compound\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.46218425466285334,\n        \"min\": -0.9991,\n        \"max\": 0.9999,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3614,\n        \"samples\": [\n          -0.5806,\n          0.6663\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

And in this case, the great marriage between Disney and Pixar work so well that the result is Magic. Magic for its original scenario, for the characters, the design and of course, and above all, the terrific animation. While a rat is not a very lovable animal, Pixar succeeded to make a little rodent, and all his family, most adorable and friendly. I tell you, you wont see a rat the same way after watching ratatouille ! By the way, the selling of rats in the UK, as a pet, had been grown up to 50 % since the release of the movie. Not 10/10 because of the score and the song, sang in a very weak, broken french. But over-whole, once again, a great journey into magic. Dreamworks can still manage and try to do better. But without a good writer and director, they will only do pale copies.\",\n          \"With the release of Tangled and Frozen so close together, Disney is showing that it still has the quality that we loved of it in the late 80's and 90's.<br/><br/>While I feel that the story wasn't quite as captivating as that of Tangled's, the musical numbers more than make up for it, special praise being for \\\"Do You Want to Build a Snowman\\\" and (obviously) \\\"Let it Go\\\". The strength of these musical numbers (in my opinion) pulls this up to a par with Tangled.<br/><br/>What I give more praise for is the film's originality in terms of plot, it's not every day that I watch a Disney film and find myself pondering who the main antagonist will be, and how the film will end, hats off to that, and for giving yet more empowered female characters. It's good to see Disney moving along with the times.<br/><br/>All in all I recommend this film to any fan of Disney, and any film fan in general, I wasn't sure what all the buzz was about at first, but now I have seen it I can see it is justified. 10/10\",\n          \"I've always been very impressed by animated films, I think they're generally of a very high standard. There is a strange apprehension that many adults seem to have about them; that they're silly, just for kids. It's completely irrational. I think animation is actually the \\\"genre\\\" with the highest consistent standard. They almost always have far more detail than live-action entertainment. Everything you see was specifically put there, it was built from scratch. Nowadays it's possible to get lazy with the use of computers, but with the right attitude, CGI only opens up more possibilities. It also allows for more exaggeration and symbolism; you aren't limited to the reality everyone is used to. You can set up your own rules which is far more refreshing and exciting.<br/><br/>The characters are very strong and human in Frozen, especially Ana. She loves her sister Elsa and just wants to play with her all the time. She loves her so much that it hurts every time she's turned down and yet she is still just as excited to play with her the next time. There is a lot of physical comedy with Ana. She is very energetic and positive and careless. We see her heart and her insecurities, she is very likable.<br/><br/>The story is quite adult in some ways. Many families will experience some kind of strain or separation, whether temporary or permanent. Each side has their own point of view and are often trying to do the right thing; it's complicated. People get hurt, years pass and there is anger and guilt and regret. And hopefully, there is still love.<br/><br/>The characters we meet are all interesting and quirky. We get a good feel for their personality from the get-go. There are twists that may teach kids to think twice about first impressions. Elsa isn't evil but is conflicted and dangerous which is a nice change from typical villains in movies. The action scenes are done really well. There are only a few parts that are a bit weaker or predictable (the troll song seems unnecessary). The voice-acting is fun and varied, they say lines in interesting ways that bring out more meaning.<br/><br/>Olaf is very funny and offbeat. He fills in a familiar position in these kinds of movies but his timing and manner is unique. You aren't quite sure what he's going to say but it's generally very funny. He makes matter-of-fact observations halfway between obvious and profound.<br/><br/>Although the music is very nice, I think the transitions were too forced and artificial. A bit too perfect. The songs fall too conveniently into standard show-stopping number formats. Reminds me of Wicked and Glee - let's all stop and sing loudly and proudly and colourfully with shining lights on us. It should be natural, an emotional expression of the character's feelings and desires. Not a show-off piece of pop music with \\\"hilarious\\\" lines thrown in. Still, the songs are very good and sometimes funny. But there could be more of a common thread or style running through them and more originality or boldness.<br/><br/>It's unfair and naive that the world seems to look down at \\\"kid's movies\\\" (any genre other than drama apparently deserves no respect). If anything, they usually achieve more than other films. They manage to move us, make us laugh or sing or smile or cry. They do this without swearing or being excessively violent or sexual (easy ways to affect people or to be \\\"ground-breaking\\\"). They draw us in with simple, beautiful stories and characters. All made possible by the tremendous amount of talent, passion and hard-work going on behind the scenes.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"UniqueID\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 23,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Zootopia 2016\",\n          \"Toy Story 4 2019\",\n          \"Inside Out 2015\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"release_date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"date\",\n        \"min\": \"2000-12-15 00:00:00\",\n        \"max\": \"2019-06-21 00:00:00\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 22,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2015-06-19 00:00:00\",\n          \"2013-06-21 00:00:00\",\n          \"2014-11-07 00:00:00\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"recent?\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"negative\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.04590281107376132,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.497,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 301,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.154,\n          0.21\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"positive\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.08313879630670448,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.88,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 561,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.597,\n          0.307\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"compound\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.46218425466285334,\n        \"min\": -0.9991,\n        \"max\": 0.9999,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3614,\n        \"samples\": [\n          -0.5806,\n          0.6663\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

And in this case, the great marriage between Disney and Pixar work so well that the result is Magic. Magic for its original scenario, for the characters, the design and of course, and above all, the terrific animation. While a rat is not a very lovable animal, Pixar succeeded to make a little rodent, and all his family, most adorable and friendly. I tell you, you wont see a rat the same way after watching ratatouille ! By the way, the selling of rats in the UK, as a pet, had been grown up to 50 % since the release of the movie. Not 10/10 because of the score and the song, sang in a very weak, broken french. But over-whole, once again, a great journey into magic. Dreamworks can still manage and try to do better. But without a good writer and director, they will only do pale copies.\",\n          \"With the release of Tangled and Frozen so close together, Disney is showing that it still has the quality that we loved of it in the late 80's and 90's.<br/><br/>While I feel that the story wasn't quite as captivating as that of Tangled's, the musical numbers more than make up for it, special praise being for \\\"Do You Want to Build a Snowman\\\" and (obviously) \\\"Let it Go\\\". The strength of these musical numbers (in my opinion) pulls this up to a par with Tangled.<br/><br/>What I give more praise for is the film's originality in terms of plot, it's not every day that I watch a Disney film and find myself pondering who the main antagonist will be, and how the film will end, hats off to that, and for giving yet more empowered female characters. It's good to see Disney moving along with the times.<br/><br/>All in all I recommend this film to any fan of Disney, and any film fan in general, I wasn't sure what all the buzz was about at first, but now I have seen it I can see it is justified. 10/10\",\n          \"I've always been very impressed by animated films, I think they're generally of a very high standard. There is a strange apprehension that many adults seem to have about them; that they're silly, just for kids. It's completely irrational. I think animation is actually the \\\"genre\\\" with the highest consistent standard. They almost always have far more detail than live-action entertainment. Everything you see was specifically put there, it was built from scratch. Nowadays it's possible to get lazy with the use of computers, but with the right attitude, CGI only opens up more possibilities. It also allows for more exaggeration and symbolism; you aren't limited to the reality everyone is used to. You can set up your own rules which is far more refreshing and exciting.<br/><br/>The characters are very strong and human in Frozen, especially Ana. She loves her sister Elsa and just wants to play with her all the time. She loves her so much that it hurts every time she's turned down and yet she is still just as excited to play with her the next time. There is a lot of physical comedy with Ana. She is very energetic and positive and careless. We see her heart and her insecurities, she is very likable.<br/><br/>The story is quite adult in some ways. Many families will experience some kind of strain or separation, whether temporary or permanent. Each side has their own point of view and are often trying to do the right thing; it's complicated. People get hurt, years pass and there is anger and guilt and regret. And hopefully, there is still love.<br/><br/>The characters we meet are all interesting and quirky. We get a good feel for their personality from the get-go. There are twists that may teach kids to think twice about first impressions. Elsa isn't evil but is conflicted and dangerous which is a nice change from typical villains in movies. The action scenes are done really well. There are only a few parts that are a bit weaker or predictable (the troll song seems unnecessary). The voice-acting is fun and varied, they say lines in interesting ways that bring out more meaning.<br/><br/>Olaf is very funny and offbeat. He fills in a familiar position in these kinds of movies but his timing and manner is unique. You aren't quite sure what he's going to say but it's generally very funny. He makes matter-of-fact observations halfway between obvious and profound.<br/><br/>Although the music is very nice, I think the transitions were too forced and artificial. A bit too perfect. The songs fall too conveniently into standard show-stopping number formats. Reminds me of Wicked and Glee - let's all stop and sing loudly and proudly and colourfully with shining lights on us. It should be natural, an emotional expression of the character's feelings and desires. Not a show-off piece of pop music with \\\"hilarious\\\" lines thrown in. Still, the songs are very good and sometimes funny. But there could be more of a common thread or style running through them and more originality or boldness.<br/><br/>It's unfair and naive that the world seems to look down at \\\"kid's movies\\\" (any genre other than drama apparently deserves no respect). If anything, they usually achieve more than other films. They manage to move us, make us laugh or sing or smile or cry. They do this without swearing or being excessively violent or sexual (easy ways to affect people or to be \\\"ground-breaking\\\"). They draw us in with simple, beautiful stories and characters. All made possible by the tremendous amount of talent, passion and hard-work going on behind the scenes.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"UniqueID\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 23,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Zootopia 2016\",\n          \"Toy Story 4 2019\",\n          \"Inside Out 2015\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"release_date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 22,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2015-06-19\",\n          \"2013-06-21\",\n          \"2014-11-07\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"recent?\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"negative\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.04590281107376132,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.497,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 301,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.154,\n          0.21\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"positive\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.08313879630670448,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.88,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 561,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.597,\n          0.307\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"compound\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.46218425466285334,\n        \"min\": -0.9991,\n        \"max\": 0.9999,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3614,\n        \"samples\": [\n          -0.5806,\n          0.6663\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
